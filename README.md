#Data Visualization Framework

1. **Big-picture considerations**:
   The Visualization should include appropriate amount of data so that it is easy to understand.
   Too much of data may overload the reader with too much of information. The  visualizations with a little amount of data might
   undermine the purpose of creating the Visualization and might not convey the required information to the user/reader.
   Data visualization should contain proper metadata to help user understand the information which is being conveyed.
2. **Color**:
   Choosing the complementary colors have favorable influence on the viewer's eyes. But the colors should be used consistently so
   that the viewers are not confused.
3. **Text formatting**:
   Choice of proper and meaningful words is very important. Each word should be made useful and understandable while limiting
   the text used in the Visualization.
4. **Menus**:
   Web users expect working menus that add value. Menus should be tested to ensure that they work properly as per their function.
5. **Interactivity**:
   The visualizations should be enough interactive to help the users analyze different data sets which were used to create the
   visualizations.
6. **Design for mobile**:
   If some of the users are mobile, the design should be compatible and suitable for different devices.
